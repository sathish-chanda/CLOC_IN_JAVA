My algorithm to Problem 3 is as follows.

1.Read the filename as a commandline argument. 
2.Check its a file or a directory.If its a file goto step 3 otherwise goto step 4.
3.Check the file type whether a java or anyother file.If its a java file goto step 4.Otherwise, goto step 10.
4.Read file count the number of blanklines,comments and codelines.Goto step 5.
5.Get list of paths of all '.java' files in the file directoy by calling recursively if its a directoy again.Goto step 6.
6.Finding the unique .java files by applying MD5 encryption on the file content which generates a unique Key for different contents.
7.Add the key into the SET if its not exists in the SET which is a considered to be a unique file.
8.Read file count the number of blanklines,comments and codelines in unique files.
9.display size of list of java files,size of SET,blanklines,comments,codelines.
10.exit.
